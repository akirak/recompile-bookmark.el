This is an Emacs package that adds support for bookmarking compilation buffers.
It stores the command and directory of =*compilation*= buffer to your bookmarks.
You can use the bookmark to "recompile" your project.
Since it is a bookmark, it persists across sessions.
** Usage
After you run =compile=, run =recompile-bookmark-store= command to store a bookmark to the command.
You can store the bookmark even outside of a compilation buffer.

Then you can rerun the command by invoking the bookmark.
